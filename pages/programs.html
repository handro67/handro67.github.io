			<h1>Programs</h1>
			<h2>Spring Lacrosse Programs</h2>
			<p>Spring is the primary Lacrosse season, and Windham Lacrosse is a member participant in the New Hampshire Youth Lacrosse Association 
			(NHYLA, <a href="http://www.nhyla.org">www.NHYLA.com</a>). Practices usually begin indoors at one of several indoor sports centers (contracted time) or in school gyms 
			in April before the fields are dry enough to permit use. When the fields become available, practices move outdoors for the remainder 
			of the season.</p>
			<p>NHYLA organizes a 7 to 8 game schedule for each team with games played on Sundays. Practices usually occur during the week.</p>
			<p>The following teams will be supported for the Spring season:<br>
			- Little Laxers Co-ed Instructional Program<br>
			- 8U Boys and Girls<br>
			- 10U Boys and Girls<br>
			- 12U Boys and Girls<br>
			- 14U Boys and Girls<br>
			There are coaching opportunities at all levels; no experience is needed; we will pay to get you certified.</p>                
			<p>The Little Laxers program will introduce kids to lacrosse.  The focus will be on fun and exercise.  The program includes a few indoor 
			sessions in mid-March.  Other than a lacrosse stick, NO equipment is needed.</p>

            <h2>Fall and Winter Lacrosse</h2>
			<p>Fall and winter Lacrosse is available on a smaller scale for those players who want to play during the traditional off-season. For boys, 
			there is a weekly "skills development" practice one night per week. In addition, during the past several years, one or more youth level 
			teams have been entered in either Granite State Lacrosse or Tomahawks Lax winter leagues run at area indoor facilities. Games are typically 
			on Sundays and the level of play is generally above the "beginner" level. Speak to the Boys or Girls Directors to learn more about fall and 
			winter Lacrosse.</p>

            <h2>High-School Level Lacrosse</h2>
            <p>Interested parents of high school aged players and Windham Lacrosse have also organized indoor league teams for high school age players the 
                past several years. The focus here is skills and playing experience to build the Windham High School program. Contact the Boys or Girls program 
                directors for additional information.</p>
            <p><strong>REFUND POLICY: </strong>Funds will be returned if requested within 30 days of registration.</p>
