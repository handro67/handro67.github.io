            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Windham Lacrosse exists to provide a positive, team oriented Lacrosse experience to the players and parents of Windham. To accomplish 
                this, coaches, players and parents will adhere to the highest standards of sportsmanship and fair play. These traits will be valued 
                more highly than Lacrosse or athletic skills, and the coaches involved in this organization have all agreed to these principles.</p>
			
			<p>Windham Lacrosse works in association with other local lacrossse clubs and organizations in order to cater to a variety of age brackets, skill levels, and gender.
			To find more information about other programs that Windham Youth Lacrosse works in collaboration with, please see the <a href="programs.html">Lax Programs &amp; Camp Information</a> section
			of our website.</p>
			
			<p>The Windham Youth Lacrosse Board abides by a strict set of rules that are established as By-Laws. All board positions and responsibilites are pubished and viewable to the public in the
			<a href="bylaws.html">By-Laws</a> section of the website. There are often open positions so if you are interested, please contact us. There are also many ways to get involved and support
			Windham Youth Lacrosse other than taking up a board position. Fundraising, team dinners, or volunteering to coach are great ways to get involved. Please email the president for more information.</p>
