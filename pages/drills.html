			<p>One of the best ways Lacrosse players can hone in on their skills is through practice. Players can practice and improve in 
			a various of different ways. To start, players can stretch, exercise, do yoga, or work on hand-eye coordination as casual
			ways to improve. Doing drills like passing, shooting, and craddling outside for practice are excellent ways to work on 
			real world scenarios</p>
			
			<p>Some of the most common drills worked on during practices are:
			<ul>
				<li>Ground ball drills in 1v1 or 2v2 settings</li>
				<li>Shooting Drills</li>
				<li>Full/Half/quarter field passing/catching/ground balls</li>
				<li>Half-court defense</li>
				<li>Offense in half-court (crease drills)</li>
				<li>Setting picks, cutting</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Concepts including teamwork, communication, sportsmanship, setting picks, and defense are all complicated and sometimes neglected
			aspects of lacrosse as well. Making sure that all of these elements are touched upon during team practice or even when working on your skills
			by yourself are important to developing as a player.
			</p>
			<p>Below, you will find some documents that can help assist coaches and players alike as they work to develop 
			their skills as lacrosse players
